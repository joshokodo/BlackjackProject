### Blackjack Project

## Week 3 Skill Distillery Weekend Homework

This program simulates a blackjack game with
all rules found in a typical blackjack game
including soft and hard aces, hitting, staying,
and a betting system with the option for double
downing all with ascii art visuals for the cards. 
(split option in the works)

## Program Overview

When program starts, user is prompted with playing
game or exiting program. When game starts, user is 
prompted to enter a bet. Afterwards, user is proceeded
through a single game of Blackjack, with the results of 
the game printed to screen after and the option to play again
or exit the program.

## Technology / Techniques Practiced 

The use of Collections, Interfaces, Inheritance, encapsulation, Polymorphism and basic OOP
principles. 

## Lessons Learned

Testing with JUnit could have simplified the process. This project was essentially
designed as I went and with proper planning before hand, could have finished without
the need of refactoring as frequent. Though the code is unlikely to run into any errors,
more error checks and exception handling would have guaranteed no errors.
