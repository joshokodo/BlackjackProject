#### Lessons Learned
- Testing with JUnit could have simplified the process. This project was essentially
designed as I went and with proper planning before hand, could have finished without
the need of refactoring as frequent. Though the code is unlikely to run into any errors,
more error checks and exception handling would have guaranteed no errors. 


#### Problems/Issues
- No serious problems but found myself refactoring alot. 


#### Stretch Goals
- I wanted to add a split hand functionality and refactor the UI code to be more effecient
